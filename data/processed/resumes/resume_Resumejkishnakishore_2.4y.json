Projects \n\n1)  Heritage foods profit prediction for succeeding year. \n\nTeam: 4 members \n\n Model : Keras Regression \n\n Duration : 1 year 2 months \n\n\uf0b7  Heritage Foods Limited is one of the largest private sector dairy enterprises in southern         \n\nIndia. \n\n\uf0b7  Worked on a Heritage project to find out expected price amount that can be generated for \n\nnext year based on various features which is highly correlated to each other and applied \n\nKeras Regression to build model and predict price. \n\n\uf0b7  Process : Given tones of data to analyse which consist of many features mainly milk \n\nquantity, cheese, ghee quantity, butter, ice creams, curd and so on... \n\n\uf0b7  Asked us to predict profit for next year by sending new data of same features. \n\n\uf0b7  Preprocessing : Analysed complete data performed imputation, handling outliers, \n\ncorrelation, multi variate normality, handled imbalance data set \n\n\uf0b7  To handle outliers I used boxplot and I found data is independent variables are highly \n\nuncorrelated by dependent variables so I used up sampling to solve, found there is no \n\nmulti variate normality used log transforms for normal distribution. \n\n\uf0b7  Handled imbalance data set using up sampling to find weather model is a good fit or not \n\nusing R squared, and removed unwanted columns. \n\n\f\uf0b7  Building model : Used deep learning technique Keras Regression to build model. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n \n\n       2) Topic modelling for an application.   \n\n\uf0b7  Team : 5 members \n\n\uf0b7  Model : Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) \n\n\uf0b7  Duration : On going \n\n\uf0b7  Process: Tones of documental data has been provided and asked then to assign topic for \n\nevery documents and topics names are Buyer, Seller Buyer and Seller Normal document \n\nwith normal data \n\n\uf0b7  Preprocessing:  Preprocessing  of  data  is  done  by  using  NLP  that  involves  steps  word \n\ntokenization, lemmatization, bag of words and TF-IDF Vectorizer \n\n\uf0b7  Working on above process to clean entire data and representing it into integers in matrix \n\nformat. \n\n\uf0b7  Building  Model:  After  preprocessing  LDA  is  used  for  building  model  LDA  does  assign \n\nTopic for each document. \n\n\uf0b7  LDA : LDA is a process used to build a model to assign topics for text data which is in the \n\nformat of intigers \n\n\uf0b7  This works based on  probability where its final outcome is highly accurate. \n\nEducation: \n\n\uf0fc  Graduated from SV university with 80% aggregate \n\n\uf0fc  Board of Intermediate Education, Narayana Junior College with 82.3%. \n\n\uf0fc  Board of Secondary
